## Introduction
Conversational information seeking (CIS) is concerned with a sequence of interactions between one or more users and an information system. Interactions in CIS are primarily based on natural language dialogue, while they may include other types of interactions, such as click, touch, and body gestures [\[Zamani et al. \]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08808).
This repository is designed to index and reflect the primary resources in the CIS and CIR fields. It is an ongoing project and will be updated regularly. Any contribution via sending pull requests is appreciated.

## Timeline
This is the [CIR/CIS any events Timeline](TIMELINE.md)! The latest uncategorized events can be found here. 
In this section every new event is reflected chronologically. It is separated to another document to saving the structure of this document.

## Contributing
